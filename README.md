## Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

- This is a solution to the [Job listings with filtering challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt).
- This is a simple filterable job listing website made with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Listings are created by fetching the data from an in-built JSON file, and each listing contains some predefined filter tags that users can select and apply.
- This project has been created to showcase my core programming (language) skills.
